# hello-world
My start of a great journey. 
I was lost, but now I am found. This is the end of a struggle and the start of a new generation of happiness and joy. 
You found me, and I have found you. This is only a quest of complete fullfilment in life. Bankai! 
First: I study HYF program. 
Second: I do errands a small ammount of time every day. 
Third: Enjoy mah life in between! 
Repeat.
